*  I will make a program which ***produce time table or study schedule automatically*** so users can use these things as prototype of their own time table.
  I think this program is awesome and roughly there are two reasons. :wink:

_  First of all,  this program will **reduces time** used for planning dramatically. Because this program will give prototype schedule table which is very personalized and users need to modify that table only one or two times to get perfect time table.
 
_  Secondly,  this program will help users to make more **achievable** plan. In this program users can get personalized data report then users can specify what they need to plan especially this report can be very helpful to people who are awkward in planning yet.

##### If you are interested in this program I recommend to run [code](https://github.com/TrainGPT/Oh-so-gi/blob/main/scr/code) or you can email me  _<sub> icandoitjina@naver.com </sub>_ :relaxed:
